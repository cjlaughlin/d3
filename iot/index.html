							<h1>Coordinated Care</h1>
							<p>At first Debbie thought that she might just be tired. But as weakness turns to confusion and she can't seem to remember her sister's phone number, it's clear that she's having a hypoglycemic attack. And she's alone.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_1_text">
							<h1>Real-Time Tracking</h1>
							<p>Debbie wears a monitor that tracks her blood glucose levels and sends the data directly to her meter. The data is also stored securely in her electronic medical records and available to her doctor.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_2_text">
							<h1>Emergency Contact</h1>
							<p>Debbie's meter does more than display her blood glucose level. It was programmed by her doctor to alert him as soon as her glucose drops below critical levels and locate her so that he can send help.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_3_text">
							<h1>There In A Flash</h1>
							<p>Convinced that Debbie is in need of urgent care, Dr. Kim uses his tablet to identify the ambulance that is currently closest to her house and dispatches it immediately. The technicians in the ambulance also receive notes from  Dr. Kim.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_4_text">
							<h1>Remote Physician</h1>
							<p>Dr. Kim, Debbie's primary care physician, receives a message on his device that Debbie's blood glucose has reached critical levels. He reviews the data on his device, instantly compares it to his notes and to other historical patient data, and formulates a plan.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_5_text">
							<h1>Drive Time Search</h1>
							<p>As they race to the hospital, the technicians send information directly to area hospitals to identify the Emergency Room with the shortest wait time and the most relevant doctor on call. And when Debbie arrives, they are ready for her.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_6_text">
							<h1>All-In-One ID</h1>
							<p>In addition to her name and address, the RFID tag on Debbie's ID card also provides the EMTs with emergency contact information, medication allergies, and insurance information.</p>
						</div>

							<h1>Late for Dinner</h1>
							<p>Greg is on his way to Chicago for the biggest dinner meeting of his life. But with his quota hanging in the balance, his flight is delayed by two hours. By the time he finally lands, he has 45 minutes to get from his seat to the restaurant.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_1_text">
							<h1>Curbside Service</h1>
							<p>By connecting directly to the airplane's GPS data, the hotel's shuttle service knows exactly when Greg will arrive and dispatches a car to pick him up in the arrivals area.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_2_text">
							<h1>Automatic Check-In</h1>
							<p>As soon as Greg's smart watch picks up a signal, the check-in process begins-his reservation is confirmed, his room is assigned, and his preferences are applied.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_3_text">
							<h1>Drop-and-Go</h1>
							<p>Because his room is already assigned, the RFID tags on Greg's bags can be connected to his reservation. So now he can drop his bags off with the bellhop and head straight to the restaurant -confident that his luggage will end up in the right place.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_4_text">
							<h1>Choose Room Preferences</h1>
							<p>Greg's hotel shuttle features a tablet connected directly to the hotel's reservation system. From here, he can change his preferences, request an upgrade, and confirm his reservation at a restaurant across the street from the hotel.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_5_text">
							<h1>Digital Butler</h1>
							<p>Before Greg heads back to the hotel, he logs into the hotel app to make sure his room is just right. With one click, he sets the room lighting, closes the blinds, programs the temperature, and sets his alarm for 6am.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_6_text">
							<h1>Dishing and Dashing</h1>
							<p>After dinner is over, Greg settles his bill. Using a table-based POS system, he reviews his charges, swipes his credit card, adds a tip for his server, and has the receipt sent to him  via e-mail.</p>

							<h1>A Storm is Coming</h1>
							<p>It's 2pm on a Thursday afternoon and the wind is picking up. As a strong storm front makes its way towards the coast, Local Power Company and North Industries are bracing themselves for STORM MODE -a citywide system for smart management of power usage in inclement weather.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_1_text">
							<h1>The Social Grid</h1>
							<p>With smart meters installed in every office building in the city, Local Power can continuously monitor power usage on a building-by-building basis and ensure that everyone is in compliance with the STORM MODE program.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_2_text">
							<h1>The Intelligent Utility Pole</h1>
							<p>Five years ago, Local Power installed nodes on utility poles around the city to help streamline the gathering of smart meter data and proactively help to determine when to trigger STORM MODE. And this is one of those moments.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_3_text">
							<h1>Climate Control</h1>
							<p>Don, North Industry's facilities manager, receives a message from Local Power that his company's energy use is nearing its STORM MODE limit. To stay compliant, he uses his tablet to turn off the HVAC in all empty conference rooms.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_4_text">
							<h1>Down But Not Out</h1>
							<p>In exchange for discounts on energy costs, North Industries has agreed to allow Local Power to automatically shut off non-essential circuits while the city is in STORM MODE. North's employees hardly notice the difference.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_5_text">
							<h1>Mind the Draft</h1>
							<p>The sound of thunder reminds Cara, North Industry's CFO, that she left her window open when she left the house this morning. With the tap of a button, the window is closed and her wood floors are spared.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_6_text">
							<h1>Shut It Down</h1>
							<p>Local Power's smart outlets are programmed to recognize potential power surges and offer residential customers the option to safely shut down any synced devices.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="home-content">
						<div class="text initial">
							<h1>The Daily Grind</h1>
							<p>It's 6 years from today and you're still getting used to being called CEO. But, as you've quickly learned, some things never change. You wake up and realize that the day you planned is not the one you'll have.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_1_text">
							<h1>Lookin' Smart</h1>
							<p>When you reach into your closet, you see your trustworthy black sport coat -it's been charging all night. When you walk outside, it senses the chilly air and automatically tightens the fabric, keeping you toasty.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_2_text">
							<h1>Business Standard Time</h1>
							<p>It's 6:00am and your alarm is blaring. You had set it for 8:00am, but the meeting invite was updated by the client while you were asleep and so your alarm clock automatically adjusted to make sure you're up on time.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_3_text">
							<h1>Personal Chef</h1>
							<p>You walk into the kitchen to make breakfast. When you get to the refrigerator, it takes an inventory of the items inside and recommends some low calorie breakfast options.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_4_text">
							<h1>Safer Stovetop</h1>
							<p>In a rush to leave the house, you accidentally forget to turn off the burner. Five minutes later, the stove's motion sensor recognizes that you're no longer in the house and powers down the stovetop.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_5_text">
							<h1>Road Warrior</h1>
							<p>Even before you get outside, your calendar app syncs with your car to program your GPS, warm up the car, and queue up your “1-Hour Drive” playlist. From there, it's up to you-drive or be driven.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text icon_6_text">
							<h1>One-of-a-Kind Lock</h1>
							<p>As you leave the house for work, there's no need for a key. Your door has a fingerprint sensor that automatically locks every door of the house, powers down all indoor lights, and activates your alarm system.</p>
